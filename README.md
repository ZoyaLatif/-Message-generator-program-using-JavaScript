# -Message-generator-program-using-JavaScript

Project Title: Message-generator-program

Description: For this project, I built a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.
How to use: Use command line, Develop locally on your computer

 Technologies: JavaScript, Git and GitHub, Command line
